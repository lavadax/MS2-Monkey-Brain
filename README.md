<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT-->
## About The Project

<!-- TODO add screenshots of finished project-->


### Built With

* [Bootstrap 4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used to assist responsiveness and streamline the positioning & styling of the site.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) / [Gitpod Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) - Used to develop the site and push the project to Github.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used to add icons for social media links.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) - Used to host the project during and after development.
* [MockFlow](https://mockflow.com/) - Used to set up the wireframes at the start of the dev cycle.



<!-- DEPLOYMENT TODO expand on this-->
## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. On the left hand side, click the "Pages" section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. Click "Save".
6. The page will automatically refresh.
7. Locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the Green box on the top part of the page.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top right of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Click [Here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.

### Future Plans


### Open Issues

See the [open issues](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

### Past Issues

See the [closed issues](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for a list of the closed issues.

Other past issues to note:  
* When testing the collision detection script initially, it would infinitely loop around 20-25% of the time due to incorrect variable manipulation turning integers into strings while checking overlap.

### Site & Methodology Changes

As I'm still learning about Github while working on these projects, the features I started using more recently are [projects](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/projects/1) and [releases](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/releases).

During the initial planning phase, I had the idea of using cookies to keep track of past activity/records, and preferred theme, but my mentor suggested using localStorage instead.  
As I had no backend information on either option, I went with the suggestion and started planning for it while working on the html & javascript.  
At some point I got concerned about storage limitation so I ran some tests, and here are the results:
![localStorage commands](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/blob/master/documentation/localStorage.png)  
Based on the results, I can reasonably assume that if someone plays 1000 times, every single day, I can store upwards of 722 days of data.  

Initial plan was to use a canvas as a game area, however it quickly became clear that hooking event listeners to auto-generated objects would require a lot of effort, so I changed my focus to SVG instead.
