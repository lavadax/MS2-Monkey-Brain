<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->
## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. On the left hand side, click the "Pages" section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. Click "Save".
6. The page will automatically refresh.
7. Locate the now published site link in the Green box on the top part of the page.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. At the top right of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

### Future Plans


### Open Issues

See the [open issues](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

### Past Issues

See the [closed issues](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for a list of the past issues.

Notable past issues:  
* When testing the collision detection script initially, it would infinitely loop around 20-25% of the time due to incorrect variable manipulation turning integers into strings while checking overlap.  
* While the initial plan was to use cookies to save data, I decided to move to local storage instead, at the suggestion of my mentor.
* Initial feedback from friends was heavily focused on needing an introduction/tutorial of the page, as the purpose/navigation wasn't easily figured out, requiring the unplanned use of Intro.js.
* As the historical data is stored as a string in local storage, converting it to specific days/months was easy, but sorting by week required a more complex solution of changing the string to a date object and then checking for specific weekdays.  
* Importing data worked smoothly once I figured out how to copy variable data, but due to how I set up the function calls, if there was data saved locally for the current date, while also importing data for the current date, the data would be added together giving an incorrect result.

### Site & Methodology Changes

As I'm still learning about Github while working on these projects, the features I started using more recently are [projects](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/projects/1) and [releases](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/releases).

During the initial planning phase, I had the idea of using cookies to keep track of past activity/records, and preferred theme, but my mentor suggested using localStorage instead.  
As I had no backend information on either option, I went with the suggestion and started planning for it while working on the html & javascript.  
At some point I got concerned about storage limitation so I ran some tests, and here are the results:
![localStorage commands](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/blob/master/documentation/localStorage.png)  
Based on the results, I can reasonably assume that if someone plays 1000 times, every single day, I can store upwards of 722 days of data.  
Even after the exact syntax of the localStorage has changed, I would still estimate the browser would have roughly 500 days worth of space.

The initial plan was to use a canvas as a game area, however it quickly became clear that hooking event listeners to auto-generated objects would require a lot of effort, so I changed my focus to SVG instead.

<!-- TESTING -->
## Testing

### Validation

As the first part of validation, I decided to validate the CSS files using [jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), as any potential errors would be quick and easy to fix.  
Both CSS files came back clean without any errors.  
  
style.css:  
![style.css validation](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/blob/master/documentation/Style-validation.png)  
  
themes.css:  
![themes.css validation](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/blob/master/documentation/Themes-validation.png)  
  
Moving on, I ran my html through the [markup validator](https://validator.w3.org) by opening my page and copying the html code, as some of it is applied by javascript.  
I used the game code as a first test, which unfortunately returned the same code 4 times, along with a warning which can be seen below.  
  
![first game validation](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/blob/master/documentation/Game-validation-1.png)  
  
After fixing the aforementioned errors, All that was left was the warning, which didn't affect the page in its current state.  
putting the history code through the validator gave the same result, as the core html is largely the same across both pages.  
  
Game code:  
![second game validation](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/blob/master/documentation/Game-validation-2.png)  
  
History code:  
![history validation](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/blob/master/documentation/History-validation.png)  
  
Lastly, there's the javascript code. for this I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com) to validate the code.  
After removing any mention of ES6 features, and letting JSHint assume jQuery was being used, I'm left with 24 warnings and 2 undefined variables.  
The variables were actually native chartJS and introJS variables, so these can be ignored.  

![first javascript validation](https://github.com/lavadax/MS2-Monkey-Brain/blob/master/documentation/Javascript-validation-1.png)  
  
The most common issue was missing semicolons, which are fixed very easily.  
This leaves me with 3 warnings: Redefining "history", a "for in" not being wrapped in an if statement, and a misleading line break.  
Until now I was unaware "history" was a reserved word in javascript, but this is an easy fix: change all mentions of "history" to "hist".  
Wrapping the for loop in an if statement seemed kind of pointless, so I instead replaced it with a forEach.  
Lastly, I'm leaving the misleading line break in, since I broke the line in 2 on purpose, to prevent it from becoming too long.
You can see the result below.

### Testing User Stories

#### First Time Visitor goals  
  
* I want to easily understand the purpose of the site  
  
In order to make sure the purpose of the site is clear when opening the page, A simple site introduction has been implemented that will automatically launch when the site is opened.  
  
* I want to be able to easily navigate the site and access the content it provides  
  
The site content is spread across 2 pages with very minimal navigational elements as a result.  
All buttons have appropriate text content and have a clear purpose.  
Every button has a size that makes it easy to both click on with a mouse, or tap with a finger in the case of a mobile device/touch screen functionality.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
  
* I want to easily return to where I left off previously  
  
At the end of every session, and at specific moments while navigating the site, current progress is saved in localstorage and is loaded again every time the site is opened.
  
* I want to easily check my progress so far  
  
The site contains a history tab, where the previously achieved progress can be viewed in an easy to read format.  
  
* I want the possibility of accessing my previous data on new devices  
  
As the current progress is saved in the browser's local storage, progress is limited to only that specific browser, on that specific device.  
In order to facilitate cross-platform and cross-browser progress, it is possible to extract the progress through the site's export function, and import it into the preferred device/browser.
